1. Go to https://git-scm.com/download/win to download and install 64-bit Git for windows
2. Accept all installer defaults and finish installation
3. Go to the Start menu and type *git bash* into the search bar, then run *git bash*
4. In *git bash*, type ```cd ~``` to change into your home directory.
5. Type ```mkdir codeHome``` to create a directory for your coding projects. Or if you already have a directory for your coding projects, type ```cd *projectsdir*``` where *projectsdir* is your coding projects directory.
6. Clone this project into your local directory by typing

```git clone https://github.com/abf149/gittrains.git```
7. Type ```dir``` and you should now have a ```gittrains``` directory. 
8. Type ```cd gittrains/speech``` to change into the speech commands directory.
9. Type ```explorer .``` to open this directory in Windows Explorer
